I'm working with this code for a personal project of mine. I'll publish the updated once I feel my bugs are worked out, provided the license is sorted too, (see below). 

Head to [https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio) to get this neat theme. 

## License
Per the original author:
"This project is **free to use** and does not contains any license."
See issue [https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio/issues/7](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio/issues/7) to see how that is going.
